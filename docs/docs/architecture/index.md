# Architecture Overview

UT-CORE’s onboard architecture is organized into core subsystems. Each has a dedicated doc with purpose, responsibilities, and interfaces.

## Subsystems

- **[Command & Data Handling (CDH)](./cdh)** — Central coordination, sequencing, and data handling
- **[Electrical Power System (EPS)](./eps)** — Power generation, storage, regulation, and distribution
- **[Attitude Determination & Control (ADCS)](./adcs)** — Attitude estimation and control
- **[Communications (COMMS)](./comms)** — Uplink/downlink and ground interface

Use the sidebar or the links above to open each subsystem doc.
