# Interfaces (ICDs)

Interface Control Documents (ICDs) define how UT-CORE subsystems and external hardware communicate.

**Planned content:**

- CAN IDs and message formats
- Power and connector pinouts
- I2C/SPI bus maps and addresses

This section is in progress. See [Start Here](../start-here) for the current doc set.
